      "As the seeemingly endless pastures stretch out before me, I thought, maybe I made a mistake leaving my town. Although freedom was scarce I didn't have to worry about surviving, things were certain and predictable. The clouds were lovely though, they stretch out farther and bigger than the sky I saw from home. I would have been happy to just die here, I saw more than I'll ever did after all.Almost comedically, as if hearing my thoughts, I stumbled upon a small outpost.                             Despite being the only building in this area of grass and flowers it blended in well. Though that may be due to it being overgrown by this very environment itself. The wind just directionless earlier was now pushing againsts my face, as if something was approaching. Looking above, I saw the cause of it. Although Iv'e only seen them in books I'm familiar with the giant vehicle that stood above, it was a kingdom class blimp, meant to carry nobles from between kingdoms. However they were about to be obsolete because of the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of other vehicles, as well as the formation of better roads. But why here in the middle of knowhere I wonder. Surely there were no other passengers. It would not be the stubbord people where I'm from, and there wasn't single town I encountered. ",
